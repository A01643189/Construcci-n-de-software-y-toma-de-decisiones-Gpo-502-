    <!--JavaScript-->

    <h1 id="section1">JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript is a versatile and dynamic programming language that is widely used for building interactive web applications. It is primarily used for adding behavior and interactivity to web pages. With JavaScript, you can manipulate HTML elements, handle events, perform calculations, make API requests, and much more.</h2>
    <div class="imagecontainer">

    </div>
    <h3>JavaScript, as a versatile and dynamic programming language, supports various types of variables. Understanding these variable types is crucial for mastering the language and building robust applications. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental types of variables in JavaScript and how they are used.</h3>

    <!--Variables-->

    <h1 id="section1.1">Variables</h1>

    <h4>Numeric Values and Arithmetic Operations:</h4>

    <h3>JavaScript employs numeric values for mathematical computations. Operators such as addition (+) and multiplication (*) are pivotal in manipulating numerical data. Precedence rules dictate the order of operations, ensuring accurate computation.</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-numeric">
        <img src="images/Numeric.png" alt="Numeric"/>
    </div>

    <h4>String Representation:</h4>

    <h3>Strings in JavaScript encapsulate textual information. They are denoted by enclosing content within single (' '), double (" "), or backtick ( ) quotes. Unlike numeric values, strings cannot be divided or multiplied; however, the '+' operator concatenates strings together.</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-strings">
        <img src="images/strings.png" alt="Strings"/>
    </div>

    <h4>Unary Operators and Boolean Values:</h4>

    <h3>Unary operators like 'typeof' offer insights into the type of a value. Boolean values, 'true' and 'false', represent binary states in JavaScript. Comparison and logical operations, such as '&&' (logical and) and '||' (logical or), facilitate reasoning about Boolean values. The '!' operator negates Boolean values, flipping 'true' to 'false' and vice versa.</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-boolean">
        <img src="images/Boolean.png" alt="Boolean"/>
    </div>

    <h4>Functions in JavaScript:</h4>

    <h3>Functions encapsulate blocks of code, promoting modularity and reusability. They allow developers to define a set of instructions under a single identifier, enhancing code organization and readability. Functions facilitate abstraction, parameterization, and isolation of code blocks from each other.</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-function">
        <img src="images/Function.png" alt="Function"/>
    </div>

    <h3>For example, the 'square' function computes the square of a given number, showcasing the versatility of JavaScript functions in encapsulating logic and promoting code reuse.</h3>

    <!--Cycles-->

    <h1 id="section1.2">Cycles</h1>

    <h3>In javascript we also have our classic cylces that allow us to use conditions in a way, to create loops were we can have diferent things happening inside them and make changes so that they can exit that loop. JavaScript has three types of cycles: while,for and labels(with 'breaks')</h3>

    <h4>While Loop:</h4>

    <h3>The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It continually checks the condition before each iteration. Here's an example illustrating the basic structure of a while loop:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-while">
        <img src="images/While.png" alt="While"/>
    </div>

    <h3>In this example, the loop continues to execute as long as the count variable is less than 5. It increments count with each iteration, printing its value to the console.</h3>

    <h4>For Loop:</h4>

    <h3>The for loop provides a concise way to iterate over arrays and perform a series of operations. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's an example demonstrating the syntax of a for loop:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-for">
        <img src="images/For.png" alt="For"/>
    </div>

    <h3>In this for loop, i is initialized to 0, and the loop continues iterating as long as i is less than 5. After each iteration, i increments by 1.</h3>

    <h4>Label as Cycles:</h4>

    <h3>Labels in JavaScript provide a way to identify loops and control their flow. They are typically used with the break and continue statements to specify which loop to exit or continue. Here's an example demonstrating the usage of labels with loops:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-label">
        <img src="images/Label.png" alt="Label"/>
    </div>

    <h3>In this example, the outerLoop label is applied to the outer for loop. When the condition (i === 1 && j === 1) is met, the break statement with the outerLoop label exits both the inner and outer loops.</h3>

    <!--Data Structures-->

    <h1 id="section1.3">Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</h1>

    <h3>In JavaScript, numbers, booleans, and strings serve as the fundamental building blocks of data structures. These atomic values lay the foundation for more complex data representations.</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-data">
        <img src="images/Data.png" alt="Data"/>
    </div>

    <h4>Data Sets</h4>

    <h3>To manage collections of data, arrays prove indispensable. Representing a sequence of elements, arrays facilitate efficient data manipulation. For instance, consider an array representing a list of prime numbers:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-while">
        <img src="images/Array.png" alt="Array"/>
    </div>

    <h4>Methods</h4>

    <h3>Both strings and arrays in JavaScript possess built-in methods to manipulate their contents. Methods like push() and pop() enable dynamic modification of array elements. Here's an example illustrating array manipulation methods:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-methods">
        <img src="images/Methods.png" alt="Methods"/>
    </div>
    <h4>Objects</h4>

    <h3>Objects in JavaScript provide a means to organize data using key-value pairs. By accessing properties, developers can retrieve or modify data within an object. Consider the following example:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-objects">
        <img src="images/Objects.png" alt="Objects"/>
    </div>

    <h1 id="section2">React</h1>

    <h2>React, a popular library for web and native user interfaces, introduces the concept of components. Components enable developers to build reusable and composable UI elements.</h2>

    <div class="imagecontainer-react">
        <img src="images/React.png" alt="React"/>
    </div>

    <h3>React its today an standard in and is the most used framework for web developing. One of the caracteristics of React are hooks which will be explained in no time.</h3>

    <h1 id="section2.1">Hooks</h1>

    <h3>React hooks provide a way to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class. They allow developers to reuse stateful logic across different components. Here's an example of using custom hooks:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-hooks">
        <img src="images/Hooks.png" alt="Hooks"/>
    </div>

    <h4>State</h4>

    <h3>Components often need to change what is displayed on the screen as a result of interaction. Writing inside a form should update the text field, clicking "next" in an image carousel should change the displayed image; clicking a button to purchase a product should update the shopping cart.</h3>

    <h3>Components need to "remember" things: the text field, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this type of memory within components is known as state.</h3>

    <h4>useState</h4>

    <h3>The useState hook in React provides a simple way to add state management to functional components:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-usestate">
        <img src="images/useState.png" alt="UseState"/>
    </div>

    <h4>useEffect</h4>

    <h3>React hooks revolutionized how developers manage state and side effects in functional components. The useEffect hook allows functional components to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations. Here's an example:</h3>

    <div class="imagecontainer-hooks">
        <img src="images/UseEffect.png" alt="UseEffect"/>
    </div>
